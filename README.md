## Getting Started

Setting up this project locally:
#### On your terminal:

- Open the project on your code editor: "cd math-magicians" and "code ."
- Install npm package: npm install.

## Live Demo (if available)


## Prerequisites

In the previous project, you worked on the setup of a React application using Create React App (CRA), now you should:

- Delete all the boilerplate from CRA (text, images, styles).
- Create a directory called components.
- Inside components, create a new Calculator.js file.
- In Calculator.js, create a React component that matches this design:
- Don't add any extra design.
- Develop just the UI of the calculator; the math logic to make it work will be added in the next project.
- Use class based components (All components should be class-based).
- Once the Calculator is ready, import it and use it in your main component (App.js).
- Test it in the browser; it should render without problems.
